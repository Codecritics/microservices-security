1. Incident commander name: Marius Tanawa Tsamo
2. Executive Summary of what happened:
An attacker deployed 3 additionnal crypto-mining pods (moneropool, minergate and cryptotonight). That attack is compromising
the availability of service  by achieving and DDos.
3. Summary of what was affected:
The attack led to high CPU cluster node consumption. The cluster control plane and api-server will be affected due to the
 shortage of resources.
4. Summary of the impact:
The cluster scaling, integrity and reliability is compromised. But also impact
the customer experience because the requests might take longer to process.
5. Summary of the remediation steps:
The Cluster administrator can evict the pods launching the following command:
kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>
He will also limit resources consumptions with setting limits and enforcing security policies.
Then he check grafana to see if the monitoring is back to normal.
6. Summary of lessons learned:
We should review access to the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and the Grafana dashboards.
Admission have to be configure to disallow malicious/unknown images to be used to create containers.
We should set an alert if the cpu reach 100% or exceeds at 95% for a long time.
