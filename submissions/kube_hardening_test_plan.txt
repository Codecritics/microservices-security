Question: How will you test the changes?
Answer: The change will be tested in a non-production environment like a test cluster.

Question: How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
Answer: We can use the canary deployment technique to gradually control the change impact on the cluster but also
implement monitoring and observablity using Prometheus and Grafana to see how the cluster react to those changes.
