Docker Threat Modeling
Given Docker's system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.
1. Spoofing: It can happens if there's a malicious sidecar container.
            Also a Docker image may be spoofed with malicious images or libaries.
            That can allow an attacker to gain admin access and manipulate docker container.
            Also we should be careful with communcation between Docker and Docker daemon and ensure it's enforced with TLS encryption.
            To avoid a Man in the middle attack and compromise the Docker Image and Registry.

2. Tampering: It can happen if Docker Daemon configuration is compromised which can lead to misconfiguration.
              An attacker may hijack the docker client to pull down an image with malware attached due to misconfiguration of docker.

3. Denial of Service: By Default the container has no limit usage of memory. Daemon memory for the running container may be over-allocated, leading to a misconfiguration.

4. Elevation of Privilege: Usage of flag --privilege, there can be an authorization clien abuse.

5. Information Disclosure: Due again to insecure daemon configuration file, an attacker can access the daemon file configuration and make malicious changes.
                           Also if thereis a traffic network spoofing, an attacker can gain access to the host and other containers.


Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
